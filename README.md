1. A random number is generated.
2. User is prompted to guess the number.
3. Feedback is given after each guess:
   - "Too high"
   - "Too low"
   - "Correct!"
4. The game ends when the user guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.
5. The user is asked if they'd like to play another round.
6. The score is updated and shown after each round.
