# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in Java

> âœ… Task 1 of the CodSoft Java Development Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a simple and interactive **Number Guessing Game** built using Java.  
The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number within limited attempts. It also offers multiple rounds of play and scoring based on performance.

## ðŸ’» Features

- âœ… Random number generation between 1 to 100
- âœ… User-friendly prompts for guessing
- âœ… Feedback on guesses (Too High, Too Low, Correct)
- âœ… Limited attempts per round
- âœ… Option to play multiple rounds
- âœ… Score tracking based on attempts
- âœ… Clean and readable code
## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. A random number is generated.
2. User is prompted to guess the number.
3. Feedback is given after each guess:
   - "Too high"
   - "Too low"
   - "Correct!"
4. The game ends when the user guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.
5. The user is asked if they'd like to play another round.
6. The score is updated and shown after each round.
